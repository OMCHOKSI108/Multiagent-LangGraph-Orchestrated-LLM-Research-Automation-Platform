- ✅ Research timeline stacks vertically
- ✅ Source cards responsive (1-2 cols on mobile)
- ✅ Chat interface adapts properly
- ✅ No horizontal scroll issues

### ✅ **Test 9: No Regressions**

**Steps:**

   - `GET /research` (with auth)
   - `POST /research` (with auth)
   - `GET /research/:id` (with auth)
   - `GET /events/stream` (with auth)
2. Verify old frontend pages still work
3. Check no console errors
4. Verify database schema intact

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All existing endpoints return expected responses
- ✅ Authentication still required where expected
- ✅ Database queries execute successfully

   grep -r "opensearch-ai" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git
   ```
2. Check imports for external dependencies
3. Verify no file paths reference opensearch-ai directory
4. Confirm all functionality works without opensearch-ai running

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ No references to opensearch-ai in code
- ✅ All features work independently
- ✅ No broken imports or missing dependencies
- ✅ Self-contained implementation

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Research jobs fail to start:**
- Check AI Engine logs for LLM connection errors
- Verify Ollama is running or API keys set
- Check database connection

**Streaming doesn't work:**
- Verify SSE endpoints return proper headers
- Check browser dev tools for EventSource errors
- Test with curl/postman directly

**Frontend doesn't connect:**
- Check VITE_API_URL environment variable
- Verify CORS settings in backend
- Check network tab for 401/403 errors

**Memory features missing:**
- Verify migration 003_user_memories.sql applied
- Check memory routes registered in server.js
- Verify JWT authentication working

**Export downloads fail:**
- Check file system permissions
- Verify markdown-pdf package installed
- Test individual export routes with curl

If all tests pass, the opensearch-ai feature merge is complete! 🎉
