# Features

The Deep Research Engine is packed with features designed to make complex research effortless.

## Core Capabilities

### 🕵️ Autonomous Research
- **Topic-to-Report**: Logic handles the entire lifecycle from a simple query.
- **Iterative Deepening**: If initial results are shallow, the agents automatically dive deeper.
- **Breadth & Depth Control**: Configurable parameters to control how wide and deep the search goes.

### 🧠 Multi-Agent Orchestration
- **Specialized Roles**: Distinct agents for scraping, reading, writing, and reviewing.
- **LangGraph State**: Robust state management ensures no context is lost during the research loop.
- **Self-Correction**: The Critique agent can reject low-quality output and force a retry.

### 📊 Data Visualization
- **Automatic Charting**: Detects numerical data and generates line, bar, and pie charts.
- **Figure Embedding**: Images are automatically embedded into the final report.

## User Interface

### 🖥️ Interactive Dashboard
- **Live Activity Feed**: Watch the agents think and act in real-time.
- **Research Timeline**: Visual progress tracker of the research steps.
- **Source Transparency**: See exactly which websites/PDFs were used.

### 🎨 Modern Design
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Fully supported theming.
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile.
- **Clean Typography**: Optimized for reading long-form reports.

## Developer Features

### 🔌 API Access
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Full control over the engine via standard HTTP requests.
- **API Key Management**: Secure key generation for third-party integrations.

### 🛠️ Extensible
- **Modular Agents**: Easy to add new agents (e.g., a "Social Media" agent).
- **Pluggable LLMs**: Switch between OpenAI, Gemini, and Groq with env vars.
