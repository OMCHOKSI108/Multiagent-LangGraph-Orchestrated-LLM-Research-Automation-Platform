ESTIMATED EFFORT CALCULATION
============================

Base Effort = 2.94 × (18,000/1000)^1.085 = 2.94 × 20.67 = 60.8 PM

Effort Multiplier ≈ 2.1 (based on driver ratings)
Complexity Multiplier = 1.3

Total Effort = 60.8 × 2.1 × 1.3 ≈ 166 Person-Months

Adjusted for academic project scope: ~25-30 Person-Months

RECOMMENDED TEAM SIZE: 3-4 developers
ESTIMATED TIMELINE: 6-8 months for full production system
CURRENT PROGRESS: ~70% complete (based on codebase analysis)
