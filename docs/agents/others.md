# Other Agents

Beyond the core quartet, several utility agents play vital roles in the Deep Research Engine.

## Review Agent

Focused specifically on the initial research plan. It looks at the user's query and the proposed research steps to ensure they are logical and likely to yield results.

## Ingestion Agent

Handles the intake of documents provided by the user (e.g., local PDFs, text files). It indexes this content into the vector database for retrieval.

## Chatbot Agent

Provides the conversational interface. It maintains context of the session and allows the user to ask follow-up questions about the generated report without restarting the research.
